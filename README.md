# World_Weather_Analysis
This was a new challenge for me as I have never used API keys before.
Generating the API key and adding it to my .py file was easy and straightforward, as well as adding updating my gitignore file in github. I found collecting the data and working with it very interesting. Running the code was very slow, especially for the weather, to connect to the weathedata website and read the data took almost 30 min and I discovered that if I leave it for too long then I have to rerun the code. The vacation data was easier, and shorter. However, I still had to run the vaction more than once because it kept on returning 'no hotels found' but the map was showing some hotels- proving that the dataframe was not empty. I depended on my notes and looking up how things are done for this challenge, especially with the new functions.
